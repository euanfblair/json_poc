This Python script is designed to scrape text content from websites and process it using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The script supports scraping from a single URL or multiple URLs listed in a file. It then processes the scraped content with OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate structured output.
Setup
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    requests and beautifulsoup4 for web scraping
    openai Python package
    Access to OpenAI's API and a valid API key

Installation

    Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
    Install the required packages using pip:

    pip install requests beautifulsoup4 openai

API Key Configuration

    Obtain an API key from OpenAI.
    In the script, replace the api_key variable's value with your actual OpenAI API key:

    python
